<p class="spacer">DID the Son of God have time to spend with children? 
Some of his disciples did not think so. On one occasion they tried to 
keep little ones from getting close to Jesus. He responded by saying: 
 Let the young children come to me; do not try to stop them.  He then 
lovingly received a group of children and spoke with them. (<a href="javascript:showCitedScripture('mr','10','13-16');">Mark 10:13-16</a>)
 Jesus thus showed that he was willing to give children his attention. 
How can parents today follow his example? By properly training their 
children and spending time with them.</p>
<p>Of course, responsible parents actively pursue their children s 
well-being and avoid mistreating them. It might even be said that it is 
 natural  for parents to show respect and consideration for their 
children. The Bible warns, however, that many in our day would no longer
 have  natural affection.  (<a href="javascript:showCitedScripture('2ti','3','1-3');">2&nbsp;Timothy 3:1-3</a>)
 And for those who do maintain a loving interest in their children, 
there is always something to learn when it comes to responsible 
parenting. The following Bible principles are therefore welcome 
reminders for parents who want the best for their children.</p>

<h2>Training Without Irritating</h2>

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Robert Coles, a noted teacher and research psychiatrist, 
once said:  Within the child there is a developing moral sense. I happen
 to think it is God-given, that there is a craving for a moral order.  
Who is to satisfy this hunger and thirst for moral guidance?</p>

<p>At <a href="javascript:showCitedScripture('eph','6','4');">Ephesians 6:4</a>,
 the Scriptures exhort:  You, fathers, do not be irritating your 
children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and 
mental-regulating of Jehovah.  Did you notice that the scripture 
particularly charges the father with the responsibility of instilling in
 his children a love for God and a deep appreciation for divine 
standards? In verse&nbsp;1 of <a href="javascript:showCitedScripture('eph','6','1');">Ephesians chapter&nbsp;6</a>, the apostle Paul made reference to both the father and the mother when he told children to  be obedient to their parents. <a name="fnt1_src" href="#fnt1">*</a></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Of course, if the father is absent, then 
the mother must assume this responsibility. Many single mothers have 
successfully reared their children in the discipline and 
mental-regulating of Jehovah God. However, if the mother marries, the 
Christian husband should take the lead. The mother should willingly 
follow that lead in training and disciplining their children.</p>

<td class="article">
<div class="float">

<p class="cap">Yelling and screaming can distress a&nbsp;child</p>
</div>

<p>How do you discipline or train your children without  irritating  
them? There are no secret formulas, especially since every child is 
different. But parents must give much thought to their manner of 
discipline, always showing love and respect for their children. 
Interestingly, this matter of not irritating your children is repeated 
in the Scriptures at <a href="javascript:showCitedScripture('col','3','21');">Colossians 3:21</a>. There, fathers are again admonished:  Do not be exasperating your children, so that they do not become downhearted. </p>
<p>Some parents yell and scream at their children. Undoubtedly this 
exasperates their young ones. But the Bible urges:  Let all malicious 
bitterness and anger and wrath and <i>screaming</i> and abusive speech be taken away from you.  (<a href="javascript:showCitedScripture('eph','4','31');">Ephesians 4:31</a>) The Bible also says that  a slave of the Lord does not need to fight, but needs to be gentle toward all.  <a href="javascript:showCitedScripture('2ti','2','24');">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:24</a>.</p>

<h2>Give Them Your Time</h2>

<p>Giving your children the attention they need also means that you are 
willing to sacrifice pleasures and personal conveniences for the sake of
 your children s well-being. The Bible says:  These words that I am 
commanding you today must prove to be on your heart; and you must 
inculcate them in your son and speak of them when you sit in your house 
and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get 
up.  <a href="javascript:showCitedScripture('de','6','6-7');">Deuteronomy 6:6,&nbsp;7</a>.</p>
<p>Today, demanding financial obligations allow few parents to be with 
their children from dawn to dusk. Yet, Deuteronomy emphasizes that 
parents  must  find time to spend with their young ones. Doing so 
requires good organization as well as sacrifice. However, children need 
such attention.</p>
<p>Consider the results of one study of over 12,000 teenagers. The 
conclusion of the researchers:  A strong emotional connection to a 
parent is the best guarantee of a teenager s health and the strongest 
barrier to high-risk behaviors.  Yes, children crave attention from 
their parents. A mother once asked her children,  If you could have 
anything you wanted, what would you like most?  All four responded, 
 More time with Mom and Dad. </p>
<p>Being a responsible parent thus means that you make sure that your 
children s needs are satisfied, including their need for spiritual 
education and close friendship with their parents. It means helping 
children to become capable, respectful, and honest adults who treat 
their fellowman with kindness and who bring glory to their Creator. (<a href="javascript:showCitedScripture('1sa','2','26');">1&nbsp;Samuel 2:26</a>) Yes, when parents train and discipline children in a godly way, they are being responsible.</p>
